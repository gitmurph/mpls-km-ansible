This lab demonstrates the deployment of an entire end to end MPLS network using Ansible and some simple Shell scripts. The lab starts off by running a provisioning script which then starts the playbooks to setup the PE routers then the CE routers followed by an end to end connection check inside the MPLS backbone and from the CE routers across the VPN Core.
